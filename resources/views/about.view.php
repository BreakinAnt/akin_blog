            <h1 class="title-lg">Kinu.blog is a personal lab for building in the open.</h1>
            <p>Kinu.blog (Akin Blog) is a lean publishing engine written in pure PHP. No frameworks, no scaffoldingâ€”just a hand-built MVC stack with routing, controllers, models, and a MySQL data layer.</p>
            <p>The project doubles as a long-term study diary. It is where I experiment with language features, iterate on architecture ideas, and ship small utilities without the comfort blanket of third-party abstractions.</p>
            <p>Inside you will find type-safe models, relationship helpers, custom routing, and other pragmatic patterns stitched together from scratch. It is equal parts sandbox and portfolio: a place to practice deliberate craftsmanship while sharing the process in public.</p>
